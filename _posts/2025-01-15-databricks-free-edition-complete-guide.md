## Advanced Tips and Tricks

### Performance Optimization Techniques

#### Memory Management
```python
# Optimize for single-node limitations
from pyspark.sql.functions import *

# Use broadcast joins for small datasets
broadcast_df = broadcast(small_df)
result = large_df.join(broadcast_df, "key")

# Cache frequently used datasets
df.cache()
df.count()  # Trigger caching
```

#### Efficient Data Processing
```python
# Optimize data types for memory efficiency
df_optimized = df.select(
    col("id").cast("int"),
    col("value").cast("float"),
    col("category").cast("string")
)

# Use columnar formats for better performance
df.write.format("parquet").save("/tmp/optimized_data")
```

### Integration Strategies

#### External Data Sources
```python
# Connect to public APIs for data
import requests
import json

def fetch_external_data(api_url):
    response = requests.get(api_url)
    data = response.json()
    return spark.createDataFrame(data)

# Use public datasets for learning
public_data = fetch_external_data("https://api.example.com/data")
```

#### Cloud Storage Integration
```python
# Leverage cloud storage for persistence
# Configure access to cloud storage where available
spark.conf.set("fs.azure.account.auth.type", "SharedKey")

# Read from cloud storage
df = spark.read.format("csv").load("wasbs://container@account.blob.core.windows.net/file.csv")
```

### Development Workflow Optimization

#### Notebook Organization
```python
# Structure notebooks for maintainability
# Use clear section headers and documentation

# COMMAND ----------
# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC # Data Ingestion and Cleaning
# MAGIC This section handles raw data ingestion and initial cleaning

# COMMAND ----------
# Import required libraries
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.sql.functions import *

# COMMAND ----------
# Define reusable functions
def clean_data(df):
    """Clean and standardize data format"""
    return df.dropna().distinct()
```

#### Version Control Best Practices
```bash
# Export notebooks regularly
# Use descriptive commit messages
# Maintain separate branches for experiments

git add notebooks/
git commit -m "Add customer segmentation analysis"
git push origin feature/customer-analysis
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Connection and Access Problems

#### Login Issues
**Problem**: Cannot access workspace after registration
**Solution**:
1. Verify email confirmation was completed
2. Clear browser cache and cookies
3. Try accessing from an incognito/private browser window
4. Check for email verification links in spam folder

#### Cluster Start Failures
**Problem**: Cluster fails to start or becomes unresponsive
**Solution**:
```python
# Try restarting with basic configuration
# Reduce memory-intensive operations
# Clear notebook state and restart cluster
```

### Performance and Resource Issues

#### Memory Limitations
**Problem**: Out of memory errors with large datasets
**Solution**:
```python
# Optimize data loading and processing
df_sample = df.sample(0.1)  # Work with smaller samples
df.persist()  # Cache frequently used data efficiently
df.repartition(1)  # Reduce partitions for single-node
```

#### Slow Performance
**Problem**: Notebooks running slowly or timing out
**Solution**:
```python
# Optimize Spark configurations
spark.conf.set("spark.sql.adaptive.enabled", "true")
spark.conf.set("spark.sql.adaptive.coalescePartitions.enabled", "true")

# Use efficient operations
df.filter(col("date") > "2023-01-01").select("important_columns")
```

### Data and Import Issues

#### File Upload Problems
**Problem**: Cannot upload large files or specific formats
**Solution**:
1. Use smaller file chunks
2. Convert to supported formats (CSV, JSON, Parquet)
3. Use cloud storage links instead of direct upload
4. Compress files before uploading

#### Library Installation Issues
**Problem**: Cannot install required Python packages
**Solution**:
```python
# Install packages at notebook level
%pip install package-name

# Use conda for complex dependencies
%conda install -c conda-forge package-name

# Import after installation
import importlib
importlib.reload(package_module)
```
