## Understanding the Limitations

### Computational Resources
- **Single-node clusters only**: No distributed computing
- **15GB RAM maximum**: Limited memory for processing
- **2-hour auto-termination**: Clusters stop after inactivity
- **No persistent storage**: Data doesn't survive cluster restarts

### Collaboration Restrictions
- **Single user workspace**: No team sharing
- **Limited external integrations**: Restricted third-party connections
- **Basic security features**: No enterprise-grade security
- **Community support only**: No dedicated technical support

### Development Constraints
- **No scheduled jobs**: Cannot automate workflows
- **Limited API access**: Restricted automation capabilities
- **No production deployment**: Experimentation only

## Best Practices

### Data Management
```python
# Save work frequently - export important results
df.toPandas().to_csv("results.csv")

# Use efficient processing for single-node
spark.conf.set("spark.sql.adaptive.enabled", "true")
```

### Effective Learning Path
1. **Start with tutorials**: Use Databricks Academy free courses
2. **Practice with examples**: Explore sample notebooks
3. **Build real projects**: Create portfolio-worthy analytics projects
4. **Join the community**: Participate in forums for support

### Working Around Limitations
- **Export notebooks regularly**: Backup your work externally
- **Use public datasets**: Leverage free data sources for learning
- **Sample large datasets**: Work with smaller subsets for testing
- **Document thoroughly**: Maintain external notes and insights

## When to Upgrade

Consider paid tiers when you need:
- **Team collaboration**: Multiple users and shared workspaces
- **Production workloads**: Automated jobs and enterprise features
- **Large-scale processing**: Multi-node clusters and advanced performance
- **Enterprise security**: SSO, RBAC, and compliance features
