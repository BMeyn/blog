## 🚀 Local Development

### Prerequisites

- **Ruby** (3.0 or higher) - Programming language runtime
- **Bundler** gem - Ruby dependency management
- **Git** - Version control and submodule support

### Quick Start

1. **Clone and setup** (first time only):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BMeyn/blog.git
   cd blog
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   bundle install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   bash tools/run.sh --host 127.0.0.1
   ```
   
   Or use the Jekyll command directly:
   ```bash
   bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload --host 127.0.0.1
   ```

4. **View your site**: Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:4000/blog`

The site will automatically reload when you make changes to your posts or configuration, enabling efficient content development.

### 🧪 Testing

To test the blog for broken links and HTML validation:

```bash
bash tools/test.sh
```

This runs comprehensive checks including:
- Internal link validation
- HTML structure validation  
- Asset reference verification
- SEO meta tag validation
