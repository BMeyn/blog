## 📝 Adding New Blog Posts

To add a new blog post to this blog:

1. Create a new Markdown file in the `_posts` directory with the naming convention:
   ```
   YYYY-MM-DD-title-with-hyphens.md
   ```

2. Add the required front matter at the top of your file:
   ```yaml
   ---
   title: "Your Post Title"
   date: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS +0000
   categories: [Category1, Category2]
   tags: [tag1, tag2, tag3]
   pin: false  # set to true to pin the post
   ---
   ```

3. Write your content using Markdown syntax below the front matter.

### Example Post Structure

```markdown
---
title: "My New Blog Post"
date: 2025-01-15 14:30:00 +0000
categories: [Development, Tools]
tags: [jekyll, blogging, markdown]
pin: false
---

## Introduction

Your blog content goes here...
```

## 🚀 Local Development

### Prerequisites

- **Ruby** (3.0 or higher) - Programming language runtime
- **Bundler** gem - Ruby dependency management
- **Git** - Version control and submodule support

### Quick Start

1. **Clone and setup** (first time only):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BMeyn/blog.git
   cd blog
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   bundle install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   bash tools/run.sh --host 127.0.0.1
   ```
   
   Or use the Jekyll command directly:
   ```bash
   bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload --host 127.0.0.1
   ```

4. **View your site**: Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:4000/blog`

The site will automatically reload when you make changes to your posts or configuration, enabling efficient content development.

### 🧪 Testing

To test the blog for broken links and HTML validation:

```bash
bash tools/test.sh
```

This runs comprehensive checks including:
- Internal link validation
- HTML structure validation
- Asset reference verification
- SEO meta tag validation

### ⚡ Git Hooks

This repository includes git hooks that automatically process blog posts when you commit changes.

**Pre-commit Hook**: Automatically runs `translate.py` on staged markdown files in `_posts/` to convert Notion-style callouts to Jekyll-compatible format.

#### Installation

**For DevContainer users**: Hooks are installed automatically when the container is created.

**For manual setup**:
```bash
bash scripts/install-hooks.sh
```

#### How It Works

When you commit markdown files in `_posts/`, the pre-commit hook:
1. Detects which markdown files are staged
2. Runs `translate.py` to convert Notion callouts
3. Re-stages the converted files
4. Proceeds with the commit

```bash
# Example workflow
git add _posts/2026-01-05-my-post.md
git commit -m "Add new post"
# Hook runs automatically and processes the file
```

#### Bypassing Hooks

In rare cases where you need to skip the hook:
```bash
git commit --no-verify -m "Skip hooks for this commit"
```

For more details, see [scripts/hooks/README.md](scripts/hooks/README.md).

### 🔄 Notion Integration

This blog supports automated synchronization of blog posts from Notion to Jekyll. Posts with status "Posted" in Notion are synced to the `_posts/` directory.

**Key Features**:
- ✅ Syncs published posts from Notion database
- ✅ Downloads and converts images automatically
- ✅ Converts Notion callouts to Jekyll prompt format
- ✅ Upgrades HTTP links to HTTPS
- ✅ **Deletes posts that are no longer in Notion** (preventing duplicates from renamed posts)

#### How Deletion Works

The sync script tracks which posts come from Notion using a `notion_id` field in the front matter:

```yaml
---
title: "My Post"
date: 2026-01-08 12:00:00 +0000
categories: [Tech]
tags: [tutorial]
notion_id: abc123...  # Tracks this post's Notion page ID
---
```

When a post is **renamed or deleted in Notion**:
1. The sync detects posts with `notion_id` that are no longer in Notion
2. Automatically deletes the orphaned post file
3. Removes associated images (cover images and inline images)
4. Keeps only the current version from Notion

**Important Notes**:
- Only posts with `notion_id` are managed by the sync script
- Manual posts (without `notion_id`) are never deleted
- This allows manual and Notion-synced posts to coexist safely

#### Running the Sync

The sync runs automatically via GitHub Actions when triggered from n8n or manually:

```bash
# Dry run (preview changes without committing)
python3 tools/sync_notion.py --dry-run

# Actual sync
python3 tools/sync_notion.py
```

**Environment Variables** (required):
- `NOTION_API_TOKEN` - Your Notion integration token
- `NOTION_POSTS_DATABASE_ID` - Your Notion database ID

For more details about the sync implementation, see `tools/sync_notion.py`.
